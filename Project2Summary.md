# Project Summary
## Vaccination Model Predictions
### Our Project
#### We set out to build and train a model that will tell us and anyone who calls the functions when our Population will reach 70% Vaccinated based on data and new Sentiments 


### Our Model
* Pull data
* Create Sentiments
* Create Sentiment Score
* Collect Vaccine Scores
* Plot Vax Score
* Pull Vax Data 
* Pull Case Data 
* PreProcessing Data 
* Model Training
* Scale Data
* Build LSTM Model
* Create Model Master Function that Pulls Other Function
* Make Predictions
* Plot Predicitions
* Deploy Dashboard

### Limitations
* Countries record to different standards
* DataPane Didn't allow for complete functionality so we went with alternative

### Functionality and Testing
* Dashboard has added options inlcuding cases predictions, as well as the Vaccine Predictions. It can also output predictions for other countries and single dose instead of the double doses exclusively. 
* Dashboard Runs perfectly and we are working on a broader deployment to Heroku

### If we had more time
* Use of Different Dashboard Deployment
* Prediction Model would be further trained for a more accurate performance
* More plotted and presented information; Such as more historical covid information - Like hospitalisations and lockdown news
* Possible Alerts for Vaccine rate or case spikes in specfic locations
* Geographical Plotting - Vaccine and Cases
* Fact Checking further into data sourcing (Particularly International)

### Delegations in Our Team 
* Tian Built the model and Pulled the Data
* Luke and Nitin Ran the Sentiments and SubSequent Plots
* Matt and Peter Set up inital Dashboard (Had Issues). 
* Tian Built and Matt + Tian Deployed 2nd Dashboard. 
* Peter Lead Presentation tool (Powerpoint)
* Matt Lead Markdown File
